 Today, we feature Mrs. Suthamerti, an inspiring author and philanthropist addressing a young audience at the Jamna-Bai Narci campus in 2017. She shares personal stories and insights on the importance of discipline, hard work, and the value of education. Mrs. Merti emphasizes the power of choices in youth and debunks myths about generational differences. She offers for a session full of wisdom and guidance for students and educators alike. Rastis, teachers and my parents and my dear students, it gives me enormous joy for me to come to school than any other place. For various reasons, A, I am a granddaughter of a school teacher, B, I am a daughter of a professor, C, I am the daughter-in-law of a school teacher. D, I myself, I am a teacher. I used to teach computer science in Christ University and later I became so irregular than my own students, then I said I will come on a management then a teacher because my of my hectic schedules. Children give me enormous joy because they are innocent. And the first time I am addressing any school in Bombay, I have not addressed any school in Bombay. I have only come to Bombay for meetings never to a school. So when the urgent meeting came down today evening, I have 7 o'clock meeting then I thought why can't I come little early? Anyway, I waste half a day in Bangalore traffic reaching airport or I rather leave it. I have been the morning reaching Bombay 830 so that I can have a session with the students and that then I opted for this. I have a grand mother of two grandkids. Like today is how grandkids are, they are like that normal. That means more talking and less listening. My grand daughter named Krishna and she told me they live in London one day I told her to eat banana fruit. We India consider it a good fruit. And then she said, she calls me Ajee, like any grand mother is called or marathoran grand mother is called. She said, Ajee, give me a set of reasons why one should eat banana a 5 years kid. I said, okay, I will tell you a story and then you feel like eating you eat. I said there was a Rishi by the name Durvasa. I am sure most of you know. Whenever you used to go to anybody's place they used to get scared of him. Why this fellow has come let him go as early as possible. I am sure when you are not a nice person nobody welcomes you. One day his wife told him, look people, when they you go people run away, they are less scared with you for such a long time. Don't you think I deserve a boon or a special gift. First he was very upset then he said, okay fine I will give you a special gift. What do you want? She said, I want a fruit which is not grown in Devaloka or above heaven which is grown on the earth. It should be used to worship God. It should flower once a year and it should not have any seeds. See all parts of that tree should be used in cooking. It should give fruits only once in a year and the fruit should be not messy kind, like not like a mango or apple. Such fruit without giving that to God the puja will be incomplete. He said, okay he made a banana tree and gave the flower fruit to the God and then he called that her name was Kadali. So he called that fruit as Kadali falah. Kadali in Sanskrit became banana in English later. So whatever banana tree you see that is the intelligence of a woman who told her husband the kind of fruit which is easy to eat, whose leaves are used for eating, whose bark is in the stem is used in cooking, whose flower is used in a cooking which flowers once a year and there are no seeds. So I told it is such a great fruit on the earth if you don't want to eat, Krishna you don't have to eat. But only learned people eat this one. What I'm telling you is, every generation, it's really wrong to tell that our generation has not more stress, that is the totally wrong parents, please remove it from your head in case you have such things. I was in Egypt about 15 years back then I took an Egyptology that is a very person who knows how to read a heroography who knows more about Egyptian history and went to one place which is 7000 years old and there I saw the pyramid. Inside the pyramid there was a heroography so I asked that fellow what it is written here you tell me. He still was told me the builder of Egypt pyramid, how it is about next generation, next generation is, doesn't respect time, doesn't respect money, doesn't respect elders, they have less common sense, they are less hardworking, I really do not know how they will survive. Suddenly I felt like you know my parents talking to me like that. Every generation feels, next generation needs less than our swerve, very hardworking we talk. No, that is really not true. Every generation has their own plus and minus, some totally same. Any mathematics teacher or any students who know mathematics will appreciate this, what is one by two, half. One by two is two by four. It is also equal to three by six. It is also equal to four by eight. It is also equal to sixteen by thirty two. The moment I say one by two and sixteen by thirty two, sixteen is a huge number, one is small but the ratio remains the same. And that is the way every generation has their own plus minus their own strength. I have seen my great grandmother, my grandmother, my mother and me and my daughter you know seven generations have seen. They are always worried about disease because if there are no antibiotic in those days, if the child gets fever the mother would have been panicked. Today I go to a pediatrician in those days it was not there. Next generation have seen there was no connectivity, coming to Bombay is once in lifetime, particularly from people from Karnataka. Every generation undergoes a different stress but they do undergo stress. Now coming to this topic they told me that they have to address students, parents. I said I wanted to address students actually but if parents are interested I can but students may get bored. I want to tell something to students and then address parents. Students you should understand one thing. When you are in school, when you are in school, somebody looks after you, your teacher, your parents look after you. They will tell you some good words and you really get bored. Then they start saram and your mind goes away somewhere because I was also a student once upon a time. Too many things someone tells you then you won't like it actually. You won't like it. And too many things who should not tell also. If we want to tell parents you should always tell in the form of a story, never tell directly you should be hard working. Other child you may not like it but please remember people who care for you only will tell. Third person will not tell. Please don't underestimate your parents and your teachers. If you are duty to understand what they are telling for what reason they are telling and you have to actually accept it and later it will pay a it's price later part of your life. What you don't learn now will never be learnt later. It is always false ideas when I grow big. You know I will do. I don't know how many of you read my book as the story of Portado. Portado is a real life story. Portado was my classmate. He was a reasonably bright. Maybe very bright I suppose. Never he came to school. Never came to college. I was an engineering college. He used to stay from Goa. He used to come here. He was in the hostel and he never used to come to college. Or college was 7 to 11. He will come around 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock. Early is mean 9 o'clock. And he will sit here sitting there at 10 o'clock, after that, after when he will come for the lab, etc. End of the year, he will 1 month, he will get up early and he will study and you know there is a method in college. You take question papers April and October. Whatever comes in October will never come in April. I am sure the school also you have. Mid-term will never come to final. So eliminate these question answers and then make a approximate question paper and study that and he used to get a first class. He did all 4 years like this. Once I asked Portado, Portado, why you are such a bright person? You don't come to class. If you come regularly, he can get distinction. You can get a rank. He said, Suda, you do not know. In life, it is not the education. It is the connection it really works. And we have to be lot of connections, you know, when you are young, it helps you. I came from a middle class family. My father was a doctor, a gynecologist. I never understood this connection. Although I think that my father was in military, we were in Calcutta, there was a club which we have never seen in our real life. So we thought maybe it was a big man. Years passed. In 1972, I finished my engineering, so was Portado and I didn't meet him for a long time. After 30-35 years, I think 2008 or 2009, I had been to Dubai to deliver a lecture. And when the lecture was over, I saw somebody waiting for. And then he said, my mom was waiting for you. I was surprised. It was a place like Dubai, who will wait for me. Then he said, I am Portado. I could not recognize because in 30-40 years people put on weight, your hair will be gray. You know, all those physical changes will happen. So I said, Portado, I would not have recognized. I was very happy. I told him, well, let us sit on and talk. He said, no, I just want to tell you one word. One word to you, so I was waiting. I said, what happened? He said, do you remember in college, I used to bunk class. I said, of course, I remember you, Portado means bunking class. He said, I used to bunk class and I joined a job. And because in those days, the moment you have a bee, you have to get a job in my time. And my bosses came to know that my subordinates came to know that I don't have knowledge. Getting a first class marks our different knowledge. Please remember parents, your children should be in the pursuit of knowledge than the marks. There is a competitive examination. I agree. It is a competitive world. It is a competitive world. Competition is a thousand times or ten thousand times more than what time I had. But with all those things, the knowledge which always helps you than your marks in real life. So he said, I got marks, but I did not have knowledge. Once the subordinates know that you don't have knowledge, they don't respect you. Once the boss knows you don't have knowledge, then he wants a reward. He said, I want to kick you out. I was kicked out from one job, then I took a nice, excellent job. And I was so much used to getting up nine in the morning. I would go to the office later. I was kicked out there also. Over a period of time, I couldn't get job anyway. And now I have a job as a manager job or a smaller job in Dubai. And I said, what about your family? She said, I have two daughters. I left them in Chennai to study. I said, what? He said, yes. I want they should study well. They should not become like me. I just waited for you to tell Sada one thing. When we were young, I used to make fun of you. He used to tell me, you are like a running race horse because of the horse. You'll see neither left nor right. It runs. Same way, you always were academic and used to make fun of you. Today, when we called you nerd, and I thought I was very smart. You know, today I feel you are successful and I wasted my life. I just wanted to tell you, if you don't discipline, if you don't discipline when you are school or in college, you pay a heavy price in later part of your life. Discipline like coming up in a proper way, writing properly, okay? Talking properly, communicating properly, respecting people properly. This really helps a long way in your life. So I don't want you should be like portado, regretting in your old age. You should remember that to be successful in life, there is no shortcut. The only method is hard work and straight way. And that you have to do. Okay. Thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to address both of you. In case you have any questions in my limited knowledge, and my answers are highly subjective. Okay. It is not that I have from any group theory I have taken. I will try to answer. Thank you once again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
